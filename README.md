# Machine-Learning
Welcome to my repository! Here, you'll find a collection of machine learning projects showcasing my expertise in core ML concepts, including machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and speech recognition. The projects span a variety of domains such as healthcare, autonomous vehicles, and image processing. Additionally, Iâ€™ve built and deployed some of the applications using Flask and hosted them on AWS, demonstrating both my development and deployment skills. Feel free to explore the projects and see the applications in action!
