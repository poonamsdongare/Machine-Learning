**Introduction:** 
This project was developed as a part of the [Good night moon early literacy program competition](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/298/). The competition aims to leverage machine learning techniques to evaluate literacy screening exercise audio recordings from children in kindergarten through third grade. The goal is to assist teachers in efficiently and accurately identifying students who require early literacy intervention. Addressing these challenges at the preschool level is crucial, as early literacy development strongly correlates with later academic success.
